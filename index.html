                      <p> This is my first decent watercolor painting. If I could still remember, I made this when I was still a Grade 11 student in STI College Las Piñas.
                          I was still learning how to use watercolor that time and I was not yet good in balancing water and pigments. After this first try, I painted a lot of
                          surrealistic paintings using watercolor. I gave most of my paintings to my best friend in Canada, because I know that she's the only one who
                          can understand my paintings. On my 18th birthday, my art mentor from Woodridge College gave me an opportunity to paint on one of the school's walls (I believe it's on the second floor, arts room) and I painted
                          this one. Of course I can't paint the same picture again, but I can repaint the same idea and emotion.

                      <p> I found this under my mattress. In case you do not know (of course), all of my old artworks are stored under my mattress (including cringe worthy artworks). 
                            I also stored my past artworks that I made when I was still in middle school and junior high school (grades 8, 9, and 10).
                            I used to join art competitions before and I even made it up to the nationals and I won the competition hahaha! (akalain mo 'yun)
                            So, back to this artwork. This is just one of my "best" practice artwork before I joined the nationals.
                            I know it is not as perfect as Leonardo DaVinci's works, but for me, this is my favorite "practice artwork". Why?
                            Because I have to practice every day for more than 3 months just to master how oil pastels blend. On my last day of practice
                            with Mr. C (my art mentor), we practiced really hard and slept really late. I ended up waking up late as well on the day of my competition hahaha!
                            I love reminiscing my journey in Woodridge College. I had a lot of fun and weird experiences.

                      <p>I made this last July 30, 2020. I used to have a lot of paintings, but this painting is the only one left. I used to paint a lot before I entered the IT industry.
                          I still find this hobby fun and relaxing, but since I am now focusing in learning software engineering I eventually stopped painting random portraits.
                          I painted this last week because I was not feeling good or stable. Quarantine made me realized a lot of things and my head was having a lot of random thoughts
                          (negative + positive thoughts). I am not good in expressing myself through writing paragraphs and essays that's why painting surrealistic artworks is my way of telling
                          people how I feel.
